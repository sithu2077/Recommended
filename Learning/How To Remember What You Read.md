### Why We Forget

- **Working memory** is limited (~7 items, 15–30 seconds).
    
- Relying on it when reading causes forgetting (like skimming stones across water).
    

### Tricks to Improve Memory

- **Chunking**: Grouping items expands what working memory can handle.
    
- **Memory palace (method of loci)**: Storing info in familiar locations using visualization.
    
- These help, but reading requires deeper methods.
    

### How to Truly Remember What You Read

1. **Shift the process**: Don’t “read → memorize → understand.”  
    Instead: **read → understand → remember**.
    
    - Memory comes from _deep understanding_.
        
2. **Encoding**: Just like computers convert files into binary, your brain must encode meaning.
    
    - Best form: **semantic encoding** (focusing on meaning & connections).
        
    - Ask:
        
        - How does this relate to what I already know?
            
        - What real-world applications does it have?
            
3. **Active Engagement**:
    
    - Use analogies.
        
    - Ask questions of the text.
        
    - Connect new knowledge to existing knowledge (spider-web model).
        
    - Move beyond passive reading into **Bloom’s higher levels**: analyzing, evaluating, creating.
        

### Note-Taking for Memory

- **Bad way**: Passive transcription.
    
- **Good way**: Notes = record of _your thinking_.
    

#### Informal Notes (marginalia)

- Write in margins: questions, connections, summaries in your own words.
    
- Highlight confusing logic.
    
- Used by great thinkers (Newton, Fermat, etc.).
    

#### Formal Notes

- Taken separately, by hand (research shows handwriting improves encoding).
    
- Steps:
    
    1. Skim chapter (first/last paragraph, headings).
        
    2. Predict key ideas, note difficulties.
        
    3. Read in sections, capture only main ideas in your words.
        
    4. Question and connect constantly.
        
- Treat it like solving a mystery: actively test the author’s reasoning.
    
- Use a structured template (like the one the creator shared via Notion).
    

### Big Takeaway

- **Reading is active, not passive.**
    
- To remember almost everything:
    
    - Engage deeply with meaning (semantic encoding).
        
    - Annotate & take handwritten notes.
        
    - Connect knowledge, ask questions, and push into higher-order thinking.
