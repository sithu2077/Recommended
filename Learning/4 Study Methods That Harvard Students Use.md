# 1. Active Recall

- The **Active recall** is a learning technique where you force your brain to retrieve information from memory without looking at your notes or the source material.
# 2. Study Like You Are Going To Teach

- Use the Feynman Technique by explaining concepts in simple terms, testing yourself with practice problems and active recall, and simplifying the information for an imaginary student to identify knowledge gaps. 
- This approach, known as the [protégé effect](https://www.google.com/search?cs=0&sca_esv=626e743b05cf6fbc&sxsrf=AE3TifPDt6i6GjwX2l8BxfJnW1kGkL6IIw%3A1757861668684&q=prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9+effect&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj70KeCwdiPAxUIX2wGHadlGLsQxccNegQIBBAB&mstk=AUtExfBKUwLmXDetYPJ2Wx5cxo-V8dXnUkanVM2_A4PwlPU1yz6S2dobwGudpCZT7cr_sglBPkaDsRYrDJE_uf9R9JbH-0Dqk3qViyQXAeAzcpjr-aB33LVYWbAAxSjqpwvdKQ8FG2rdj9TbjtFH5oVSBzqxYbEWx05z4xu9vayOlmldt6nmqIxE-0s1Qfd7zwXJSiF2tf-ovF2CrlLUL-LuUaOUPY3wgDbyWCwFF_vBv4HwZfD9Cae8YDdNLvQzfygEewABZtNa03KwaYAsHSLCSvYJAkAqakwCukR1YF6jAZWYzw&csui=3), forces deeper understanding and better retention by emphasizing understanding over memorization and creating the mental effort required to retrieve information.

# 3. 50 Minutes Study and 10 Minutes Break

- A variation of the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method where you work in focused intervals (e.g., 50 minutes) followed by a short break (e.g., 10 minutes) to improve productivity, concentration, and retention.
- This technique is designed to align with the body's natural rhythm by providing regular periods of rest to help your brain rejuvenate and prevent burnout. You can use online timers or apps to help manage your intervals.

# 4. Choose The Environment, Put Away Tech and Keep It Clean

- Choosing a supportive study environment by putting away technology and keeping your space clean improves focus, reduces stress, and increases productivity by minimizing distractions and fostering a sense of control.
- A quiet, organized, and well-lit space with natural elements promotes concentration and memory retention, allowing you to absorb information more effectively and achieve academic success.
