# 5 Elements Of Active Learning

1. **Engage:**
    
    Learners are introduced to the topic, motivated to learn, and connect the content to their existing knowledge or real-world experiences.
    
2. **Explore:**
    Students conduct hands-on activities, research, and experiments to develop a deeper, more advanced understanding of the concepts.
    
3. **Explain:**
    Learners clarify their understanding by explaining what they have learned, which can be done through discussion, writing, or teaching others.
    
4. **Elaborate:**
    Students apply their newly acquired knowledge by applying it to different contexts, conducting further investigations, or experimenting with it in new situations.
    
5. **Evaluate:**
    Learners assess their own progress, identify areas for improvement, and reflect on the meaning of what they have learned and how they learned it.
