### 🔑 Core Ideas from the Video

1. **Maths as a Foundation**
    
    - Maths is the base for Physics, Physical Chemistry, and overall problem-solving.
        
    - Weakness in maths can drag down your performance in other areas.
        
2. **First Step – Fixing Fundamentals**
    
    - Build **patience** and the ability to stay focused.
        
    - Avoid instant dopamine (like reels).
        
    - Enter **flow state** → focus deeply and solve faster.
        
    - Support habits:
        
        - 10 min meditation daily
            
        - 3–4 liters of water
            
        - 7–8 hours of sleep
            
        - No scrolling first thing in the morning
            
3. **Maths as a Web of Concepts**
    
    - New chapters rely on older ones.
        
    - If you miss basics, advanced chapters look alien.
        
    - Before new chapters, revise **prerequisites** (can ask teachers or use ChatGPT to generate a list).
        
4. **The 4 Pillars of Scoring in Maths**
    
    - **Pillar 1 (40%) – Concepts & Formulas**
        
        - Learn formulas, revise, solve formula-based Qs daily (10–15).
            
    - **Pillar 2 (40%) – Pattern Recognition**
        
        - Comes from solving **100–150 questions per chapter**.
            
        - Flow state helps in quickly spotting approaches.
            
    - **Pillar 3 – Rapid Decision-Making**
        
        - Smart test-taking: don’t waste time on ego-driven hard problems.
            
        - Solve in order: easy → medium → lengthy medium → hard.
            
        - Train this through timed mock tests.
            
    - **Pillar 4 – God-Tier Speed & Passion**
        
        - Only for a tiny fraction who dedicate years.
            
        - Not necessary for JEE success; focus on first 3 pillars.
            
5. **Practical Advice**
    
    - Balance your scores across Physics, Chemistry, and Maths rather than aiming to be “God-tier” in one.
        
    - Use recommended books + compiled YouTube resources for revision.
        
    - Most important chapters (with weightage) for JEE Mains and Advanced are highlighted (mentioned in the video).

👉 The **main takeaway**:  
If you fix your mindset, strengthen prerequisites, and consistently practice with smart strategy (pillars 1–3), you can jump from weak to strong in JEE Maths—without needing to be a “math god.”
