Solving exercises and working on projects are usually recommended in such cases. Here are some resources.

Exercises:

- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises), [Hackinscience](https://www.hackinscience.org/exercises/) and [Practicepython](https://www.practicepython.org/) — these are all beginner friendly and difficulty levels are marked
    
- [Adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/) — includes more challenging exercises for intermediate to advanced level users
    
- [Checkio](https://py.checkio.org/), [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/start), [Codecombat](https://codecombat.com/) — gaming based challenges
    

Projects:

Find something that'd help to solve a real world problem for you. For example, I'm on Linux and use the terminal for many things. I wanted a cli tool to do simple calculations. There's `bc` command, but it doesn't accept direct string and you need to set `scale` and so on. So, I looked up how to write a cli in Python (I went with built-in `argparse` module) and made a tool that'd solve my small use case.
