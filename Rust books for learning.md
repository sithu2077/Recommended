Hi, it depends with your use cases for rust. Anyway, please go through this materials: 
1. The Rust Book 
2. Programming Rust book. 
3. Async Rust book. 
For advanced Rust 
1. The Rustonomicon - if you prefer to go bare metal. Away from web development. 
2. 2. Rust in action by Tim McNamara - the code examples used are geared towards systems programming. 
For web development: 
1. Zero to production in Rust - it teaches you how to write production ready idiomatic Rust code. A lot of concepts will be covered.
